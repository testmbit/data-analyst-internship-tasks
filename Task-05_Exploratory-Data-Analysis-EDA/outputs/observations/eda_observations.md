# Exploratory Data Analysis – Titanic Dataset

## Objective
This document summarizes the key insights derived from exploratory data
analysis performed on the Titanic dataset.

---

## Survival by Gender
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
- This suggests that gender played a major role in survival outcomes.

---

## Survival by Passenger Class
- First-class passengers showed the highest probability of survival.
- Survival rates decreased progressively from first class to third class.
- Passenger class strongly influenced access to safety resources.

---

## Age Distribution
- Most passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.
- Children showed relatively higher survival rates compared to adults.
- Elderly passengers had lower survival probabilities.

---

## Fare Analysis
- Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
- Fare is closely linked to passenger class and access to safer locations.

---

## Correlation Analysis
- Passenger class and fare show moderate correlation with survival.
- Age has a weaker correlation with survival.
- No single variable alone explains survival; multiple factors interact.

---

## Overall Conclusion
- Survival on the Titanic was influenced by a combination of gender,
  passenger class, age, and fare.
- The analysis highlights clear social and economic patterns
  affecting survival outcomes.
