# Business Problem

## Background
Business stakeholders require a clear and interactive view of sales
performance to support decision-making.

Raw transactional data alone does not provide actionable insights
without proper aggregation, visualization, and trend analysis.

## Objective
The objective of this task is to design an interactive dashboard that:
- Summarizes overall sales performance
- Tracks sales trends over time
- Highlights key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Enables quick, high-level business understanding

## Stakeholders
- Business Managers
- Sales Team
- Executive Leadership

## Key Questions Addressed
- How is overall sales performing?
- How do sales vary across months and quarters?
- What are the high-level KPIs that summarize performance?
