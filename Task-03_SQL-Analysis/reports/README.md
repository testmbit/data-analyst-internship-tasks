# Analysis Reports

This directory contains the outputs generated from SQL-based data analysis
performed for Task-03.

## Contents

### Screenshots
The `screenshots/` folder contains result snapshots captured directly from
DB Browser for SQLite after executing analysis queries.

Included analyses:
- Revenue by State
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Monthly Revenue Trend

## Method
- SQL queries were executed on the final SQLite database (`olist.db`)
- Results were viewed using saved SQL views
- Screenshots serve as proof of successful query execution and analysis

## Notes
- Screenshots are provided instead of exported CSVs to keep the repository lightweight
- All SQL queries used to generate these results are available in `sql/analysis/insights.sql`
