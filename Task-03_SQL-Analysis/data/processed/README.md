# Processed Data

This folder represents processed and analysis-ready data.

For Task-03, the processed output is a SQLite database:
- `data/olist.db`

The database was created by:
1. Importing raw CSV files into staging tables
2. Inserting cleaned data into final analytical tables
3. Verifying referential integrity and row counts

No additional processed files are stored separately.
